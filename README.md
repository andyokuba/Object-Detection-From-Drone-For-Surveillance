# Object-Detection-From-Drone-For-Surveillance

## Description

In this project, we aim to accurately detect vehicles
in drone-captured images using various computer vision
models. To accomplish this, we utilize the VisDrone2019
dataset, which consists of annotated images and videos captured
by drones in different locations, environments, and
weather conditions. We evaluate the performance of several
popular models, including Faster RCNN, Mask
RCNN, Single Shot Detector (SSD), Yolo 3, Yolo 5, and Yolo
8, and compare their results. Our findings provide insights
into the effectiveness of different models for vehicle detection
in drone imagery.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can simply clone the repository and run the notebooks using Google Colab, Kaggle, or a GPU-enabled computer. The required datasets for each model can be found on the [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/) website.

## Models
- [YOLOv3](https://github.com/ni9/Object-Detection-From-Drone-For-Surveillance/blob/main/yolo3.ipynb)
- [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ni9/Object-Detection-From-Drone-For-Surveillance/blob/main/yolov5/viz_yolov5x.ipynb)
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ni9/Object-Detection-From-Drone-For-Surveillance/blob/main/Yolo-V8/YoloV8.ipynb)

## Usage
Each notebook contains detailed instructions for running the respective model. Please refer to the README file included in each model directory for additional information.
